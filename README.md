# Stencil Progress Bar

A progress bar that comes in both standard and radial flavours. 

[Demo Coming Soon](#)



## Requirements

- Sass
- AMD loader
- Dust templating



## Installation

Install the Stencil Progress Bar using the AdaptiveJS generator:
```shell
yo adaptivejs:component --install stencil-progress-bar
```
You can also install interactively by running `yo adaptivejs:component` and choosing the install option.



## Usage

Stencil components installed with the AdaptiveJS generator require no setup. Just load the componentâ€™s template in the desired view and use the dust helper to render it. For details, see [using Components in AdaptiveJS](https://github.com/mobify/devcenter-assets/blob/master/mobifydevcenter/v2.0/documentation/Components/Use%20a%20Component.md).



## API

### Template
The template accepts the following parameters.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
value | number within [0, 1] | Sets the initial value for the progress bar
label | string | Sets the initial label for the progress bar
state | one of ['inprogress', 'success', 'failure'] | Sets the initial state for the progress bar
isRadial | boolean | If `true`, uses the radial progress bar instead of the linear progress bar

This component has no template bodies.


### UI Script

If you don't need to use non-default options when initializing the Progress Bar, you don't need to include anything, as Adaptive.js will do that for you.

If you do need to use non-default options during initialization, you first require the Progress Bar UI script. Then call `ProgressBar.init`.

```js
require([
    // ...
    'progress-bar-ui'
], function(
    // ...
    ProgressBar
) {
    ProgressBar.init($el);
});
```

`ProgressBar.init` takes one parameter: `$el`.

#### $el

`$el` is the progress bar element. The component's instance is accessible through this DOM node. For instance, the following calls the `setProgress` method on an instance of the Progress Bar component:

```js
$('.c-progress-bar').data('component').setProgress(0.5);
```


#### Component Instance Methods

##### .setProgress(percentage)

Use this function to update the progress bar's value. `percentage` should be a number between 0 and 1. 

```js
$(element).data('component').setProgress(0.5);
```


##### .setState(state, label)

Use this function to change the state of the progress bar. The progress bar component supports 3 states: `progress`, `success`, and `error`. These states determine the visual appearance of the component. The label is the text displayed with the progress bar.

Upon reaching 100%, the progress bar component will not immediately transition into either success or failure states - you need to call these manually.

```js
$(element).data('component').setState('success', 'Download successful');
```


#### Events

All events are fired at the root element of the component, i.e. `<div class="c-progress-bar">`

Event Type | Description
-----------|------------
progress-retry | This event fires when the user clicks the Retry button. The Retry button is only available when the component is in the `failure` state.


### Stylesheet configurable variables

Name | Default | Description
-----|---------|------------
$progress-bar__progress-color   | black   | Set the progress bar color when state=progress
$progress-bar__success-color    | #27ae60 | Set the progress bar color when state=success
$progress-bar__error-color      | #c0392b | Set the progress bar color when state=error
$progress-bar__background-color | #888    | Set the color of the progress bar's background


## Development

* Run `npm install && bower install && bundle install`
* Run `grunt serve`
* Navigate to [localhost:3000/tests/visual](http://localhost:3000/tests/visual)



## Tests

### Visual Tests
Each component has a set of visual tests. These are implemented as an html page that is used to manually verify functionality against a spec (how it should look and behave). This is mainly useful for testing CSS and for development. You can view the tests by following the Development steps above.
